NAME
    Devel::GlobalPhase - Detect perl's global phase on older perls.

SYNOPSIS
        use Devel::GlobalPhase;
        print global_phase; # RUN

        use Devel::GlobalPhase -var;
        print ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}; # RUN

DESCRIPTION
    This gives access to ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} in versions of perl that don't
    provide it. The built in variable will be used if it is available.

    If all that is needed is detecting global destruction,
    Devel::GlobalDestruction should be used instead of this module.

EXPORTS
  global_phase
    Returns the global phase either from "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" or by
    calculating it.

OPTIONS
  -var
    If this option is specified on import, the global variable
    "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" will be created if it doesn't exist, emulating the
    built in variable from newer perls.

BUGS
    There are tricks that can be played with B or XS that would fool this
    module for the INIT and END phase.
